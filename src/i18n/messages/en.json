    "placenames-disclaimer" : "<h2>Indigenous Mapping is Relational</h2><p>Indigenous mapping does not aim to define or contain, but to honour and uplift the relationships that exist between peoples, lands, and waters. Land and waters are not resources or backdrops, they are living beings, full of life force, energy, and memory. Every mountain, river, coastline, and forest holds its own story, its own presence, its own power. Mapping, in this context, is not about naming for ownership, it is about recognising and respecting these life forces as kin.</p><h2>Sound is a Pathway of Connection</h2><p>Many Indigenous peoples connect to place through sound, through spoken language, chant, song, dance and ceremony. These are not just ways of communicating with each other, but of relating to the more-than-human world: to wind, water, stone, bird, ancestor. Indigenous place names carry these sounds. They resonate with generations of relationship and deep listening. Some names are held in sacred trust, known only to certain knowledge holders. We honour the sovereignty of this knowledge and support Indigenous data sovereignty, names are shared when and how communities choose.</p><h2>The Story of Place is Alive</h2><p>Every place holds story, not in the past, but in the now. Stories are not static histories, but living relationships that continue to unfold. When you sit with the sound of a place, its name spoken aloud, its echoes through chant or song, you may find yourself entering a moment where past, present, and future exist at once. This is the unfolding of time as many Indigenous nations understand it: layered, relational, and alive. Indigenous mapping invites this way of knowing, not just to see the land, but to feel time move through it, and to be in relationship with its ongoing becoming. Some names carry the presence of ancestors, their journeys, their teachings, their conversations with the land. These names mark moments of connection, remembrance, and responsibility, kept alive through generations.</p><h2>Mapping Beyond Boundaries</h2><p>What we hope to do with Indigenous place names is move beyond the fixed borders and definitions of colonial mapping systems. Instead, we aim to support the visibility of Indigenous relationships to land and water, connections that are multi-leveled, felt, sung, carried, and remembered. This is a mapping that is not about control, but about connection. We understand that ‘place’ is known in different ways by different peoples, this is what makes building a relationship with land and waters exciting and enduring.</p><p>If your tribal nation would like to share place names through Native Land Digital, we welcome you to reach out and walk with us in this work.</p>",
    "reciprocity-disclaimer" : "<h2>Introducing the Reciprocity Layer</h2><p>A new way to move beyond land acknowledgements.</p><p>The Reciprocity Layer highlights global Indigenous-led projects, stories of reclamation, recovery, rematriation, and resistance. It brings visibility to the ongoing work happening on Indigenous lands: from cultural revitalisation and environmental restoration, to the challenges faced by nations today, such as extractive industries and governance struggles.</p><p>This layer is a living map of Indigenous excellence. It invites users not just to learn whose land they are on, but to understand what those nations are calling for—what support is needed, what is being protected, and how to stand in meaningful solidarity.</p><p>Whether you’re offering a land acknowledgement, developing partnerships, or simply wanting to do better, the Reciprocity Layer shows you how to act with intention and care.</p>",

It’s a way of inviting users to explore Indigenous land, waters, and people through a more interconnected lens.</p><p><b>Search and click as usual to see more.</b> Also, don't worry – you can still access the <a href='/maps/native-land'>classic territories map</a> at any time.</p>",

    "constellation-disclaimer-more": "<p>For many years, our original territories map helped people begin learning about the Indigenous histories and relationships tied to place. Its overlapping polygons challenged conventional expectations of what a map “should” look like and encouraged millions of visitors to think differently about land and belonging.</p><p>Over time, though, the old map also became familiar, and sometimes too tied to Western ideas of fixed boundaries and exact territorial edges. While those polygons remain important and are still visible when you search or click, we wanted to explore a way of mapping that reflects something broader: movement, kinship, interconnection, and the relationships that tie peoples to each other and to the land.</p><p>The Constellation Map is our next step in that experiment.</p><p>Here, Nations appear as points of light connected by a loose network, hinting at stories, relationships, and shared geographies that don’t fit neatly inside drawn borders. The territorial polygons are still present at a low opacity, grounding the map in the data we’ve always used — but the focus shifts toward a more relational, less bounded way of seeing Indigenous presence on the land.</p><p>We see this as ongoing work. Indigenous mapping is always evolving, and so are we. If you have thoughts or ideas, we’d love to hear from you in our <a href='/contact'>Discord community</a>.</p>"
