### Support

The app uses basic geolocation to find your location, retrieves polygons from the https://native-land.ca website, and provides a searchable list of nations.

Internally, it uses our own [API](https://api-docs.native-land.ca/) and some special endpoints just for the mobile app to show more information.

It also uses geocoding, which is subject to certain daily limits from Google — if the search doesn’t work, this may be the issue. Please get in touch if anything seems busted.

### Privacy Policy

Our Native Land apps use your location to help you find more information, but we do not record your location.

We do log all API calls made to our API for analytic purposes, but no personal identifying information is held with those logs.

Third party libraries are employed for mapping and building of the app.

Please get in touch if you have any concerns.
