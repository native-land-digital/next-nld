### Support

The app uses basic geolocation to find your location, retrieves polygons from the https://native-land.ca website, and provides a searchable list of nations. It will work offline after you initially download the maps while connected to WiFi!

It also uses geocoding, which is subject to certain daily limits from Google — if the search doesn’t work, this may be the issue.

### Privacy Policy

Our Native Land mobile apps do not track or record your data in any fashion. Third party libraries are employed for mapping and building of the app. Please get in touch if you have any concerns.
