At Native Land Digital, we’re trying to keep up by adding lots of translations into different global languages. Particularly important to us, though, is getting translations into Indigenous languages — many of which are not common online, but are very important to make visible on the website.

**Currently Available:**

[English](https://native-land.ca/en)
[Français](https://native-land.ca/fr)
[Español](https://native-land.ca/es)
[Português](https://native-land.ca/pt-br)
[فارسی](https://native-land.ca/fa)
[Kamëntšá Biya](https://native-land.ca/kb)
[Penobscot (pαnawαhpskewi-alαtəwéwαkan)](https://native-land.ca/pan)
[Yoruba](https://native-land.ca/yo)

If you want to contribute, we have two forms you can choose from to submit a translation — the Basic translation and the Full translation.

We recognize that some Indigenous speakers may have trouble with the verbiage in the Full translation, so please feel free to submit the Basic if you can do that.

This page is currently in revision. Please contact us if you want to submit a translation!
