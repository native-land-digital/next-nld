Many organizations and individuals have helped in the creation of Native Land — it is certainly not a solo effort. We accept suggestions and fixes from the community and that is a huge part of how we can continue striving to achieve accuracy and sensitivity in our portrayal of Indigenous territories and nations.

That being said, there are a few organizations and individuals who deserve special mention:
