## About Native Land Digital

Native Land Digital is an Indigenous-led not-for-profit organization based in Canada. Our Board of Directors, made up of Indigenous people with deep connections to Land & Waters, communities, and knowledge systems, provides leadership and direction.

Our work is supported by Indigenous and non-indigenous advisors, academics and experts in mapping, GIS, Indigenous governance, and community engagement. Together, we navigate the complexities of mapping Indigenous territories:
- **Who belongs on a map?** Indigenous identity is complex and shaped by history, law, governance, and lived experience.
- **How do we represent relationships with Land & Waters?** Western mapping traditions often fail to reflect Indigenous ways of knowing, which see land, water, and people as deeply interconnected and relational.
- **What sources do we rely on?** We use oral histories, maps, and written records, always prioritizing Indigenous voices.
- **How do we balance accuracy with representation?** Borders are a colonial concept—our approach is to be expansive, making space for communities to represent themselves. We are designing a new way to map with Indigenous knowledge systems, you will start to see changes over the next year. 
- **How do we ensure Indigenous governance within our organization?** Our board and advisors guide decisions with Indigenous governance principles in mind.

At the core of our work is a commitment to self-determination. Native Land Digital does not claim to define territories—it provides a starting point for deeper conversations and engagement with Indigenous communities.

## How We Work

Our team is small, and we balance daily operations with long-term goals. The organization is run by our **Executive Director**, who manages every level of the organisation, funding, partnerships, strategy, and community engagement. **The Board** are Indigenous and Non-Indigenous experts in the field and operate as a council to oversee the future strategic planning for Native Land Digital. 

We’re always working to grow in ways that stay true to Indigenous governance principles. While funding limits how fast we expand, our priority is ensuring Indigenous representation in all aspects of our work.

**What Guides Us**

- Indigenous nations and communities **define themselves**—we don’t act as gatekeepers of identity or land.
- Indigenous representation in governance, decision-making, and partnerships is essential.
- We center Indigenous histories, perspectives, and relationships with Land & Waters, not colonial narratives.
- Our work supports Indigenous education, sovereignty, and self-determination.

## The Technology Behind the Map

Native-Land.ca is built using:
- Mapbox (for the interactive map)
- React Native and Expo (for our mobile apps)
- Google Drive, Zoom (for internal collaboration)
- Social media (to connect and share knowledge)

Our data comes from a mix of sources, with a preference for Indigenous knowledge. Each entry on the map—whether a nation, language, or treaty—includes sources and links to additional information.

We aim to use at least two valid sources per entry. These can include oral histories, written records, or maps from Indigenous communities. When conflicts arise, we take an inclusive approach, leaving space for communities to represent themselves rather than imposing rigid boundaries.

If you have feedback, corrections, or suggestions, we encourage you to reach out. We may not always be able to respond right away, but we value the knowledge that people share with us.

## Funding & Support

Our primary funder is the **Kalliopeia Foundation**, with additional support from Vancity Credit Union. Individual donors also play an important role in keeping Native Land Digital going.

We sometimes receive honorariums for talks and lectures, and we are always looking for new funding opportunities that align with our values. If you’d like to support us, donate, or share grant opportunities, please reach out!
