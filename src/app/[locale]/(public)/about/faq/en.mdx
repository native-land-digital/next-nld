## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

**What is Native Land Digital (NLD)?**

Native Land Digital (NLD) is an Indigenous-led non-profit organization that provides a digital map of Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties globally. Our goal is to support education, awareness, and research while respecting Indigenous data sovereignty. 

**Is NLD a legal resource for tribal nations?**

No. NLD does not claim to be a legal resource for Indigenous or tribal nations. Our maps and data are meant for educational and reference purposes only and should not be used for legal claims, land disputes, or governmental decision-making. We encourage users to consult Indigenous governments and legal experts for authoritative information.

## Mapping Process

**How does NLD gather and verify mapping information?**

Our mapping process prioritizes Elder knowledge as the most important source of information. We then seek at least three additional confirmations from Indigenous communities, scholars, or historical records. When knowledge of an area is contradictory, we respect and include all Indigenous perspectives, recognizing that different families, sub-tribes, and tribes may hold diverse histories. We emphasize multi- and pluriversal storytelling, acknowledging that no single way of knowing is definitive.

**Is the map complete?**

No, our map is a work in progress and is continuously updated and refined. There are many Indigenous nations, communities, and languages yet to be added. If an area appears "empty," it does not mean there are no Indigenous peoples there—it simply means we have not yet connected with the people of those lands or waters. We are actively working to expand and improve our database.

**Why are some historical terms still on the map?**

We are in the ongoing process of removing harmful Western anthropologies and colonial histories that use trauma-inducing language. This work takes time as we carefully review and replace outdated terminology with respectful and accurate Indigenous narratives. We appreciate your patience and support as we continue this important effort.

## Data Sovereignty and the Indigenous Data Sovereignty Treaty

**What is the Indigenous Data Sovereignty Treaty?**

The Indigenous Data Sovereignty Treaty outlines principles for the ethical collection, storage, and sharing of Indigenous data. It aligns with Indigenous governance values and reinforces Indigenous peoples' right to control their own data. More details can be found [here](https://api-docs.native-land.ca/).

## Giving Back to Indigenous Communities

**How can non-Indigenous people support Indigenous nations?**

Supporting Indigenous nations goes beyond financial contributions. Here are some meaningful ways to engage:

*   **Listen and Learn:** Educate yourself on Indigenous histories, languages, and current issues by engaging with Indigenous-created resources.
*   **Acknowledge and Respect:** When on Indigenous lands, recognize the original caretakers, respect their protocols, and seek permission where necessary.
*   **Amplify Indigenous Voices:** Share Indigenous perspectives and work with others to elevate Indigenous-led initiatives.
*   **Build Relationships:** Engage with local Indigenous communities in ethical, respectful, and reciprocal ways, rather than simply extracting knowledge.
*   **Advocate and Act:** Support Indigenous-led movements, policies, and efforts that uphold Indigenous sovereignty and land rights.
*   **Support Indigenous Businesses and Artists:** Purchase from Indigenous-owned businesses, artisans, and knowledge keepers to directly invest in Indigenous economies.
*   **Volunteer Time and Skills:** Offer expertise in areas such as research, technology, and advocacy, where requested and appropriate.

True allyship requires ongoing learning and action—support Indigenous knowledge and leadership in ways that center Indigenous agency and sovereignty.
