## Meet *Kōrero*: A Land and Waters Acknowledgment Guide

*Kōrero* is a conversational AI designed to help people reflect deeply on their relationship with place. It guides users through a process of meaningful reflection and commitment, supporting the creation of land and waters acknowledgments that honour Indigenous presence, knowledge, and care. 

Rather than offering a generic or scripted acknowledgment, *Kōrero* begins with the heart — encouraging users to build connection through a series of intentional questions.

## Why *Kōrero*?

Too often, land acknowledgments are written without understanding, depth, or action. *Kōrero* exists to change that — by supporting people to listen, reflect, and respond meaningfully. This is especially important for non-Indigenous peoples learning how to be in better relationship with the lands and waters they live on, and with the Indigenous Peoples who continue to care for them.

## How It Works

*Kōrero* invites users to move through three stages:
- **Relationship** – What is your relationship to the lands and waters you're on? *(Are you visiting? Living? Learning? Working with the land? Seeking connection?)*
- **Action** – What meaningful actions can you take to support the ongoing care of these lands and waters? *(Supporting Indigenous-led initiatives, learning histories, showing up for community efforts, etc.)*
- **Commitment** – How will you commit to these actions moving forward?
 *(Your acknowledgment becomes a living statement of your role in stewardship.)*

Once these reflections are shared, *Kōrero* gently weaves them together with you — alongside information from our api — into a personalized acknowledgment that has meaning.

## What Makes This Different?

- **Relational, not transactional:** It’s not about ticking a box — it’s about building respect and connection.
- **Rooted in Indigenous presence:** Indigenous Peoples are not in the past. We are here. We are continuing the work of caring for land and waters.
- **Global Indigenous care:** This tool was created to honour and support Indigenous Nations around the world. While developed in collaboration with Indigenous peoples, it avoids using language specific to any one Nation.
- **Action-oriented:** The final acknowledgment includes real, tangible commitments — not just words.

## A Note on Respect

*Kōrero* encourages care when engaging with Indigenous knowledge and communities. If you're reaching out to local Nations, consider what you can offer in return — whether that’s time, support, a gift, or a genuine commitment to listening and learning. Reciprocity matters.

Let’s change how we show up for the land and waters — together.
