# Native Land Digital Teacher’s Guide 2025

Welcome to the **Native Land Digital Teacher’s Guide!** This resource is designed to support educators in using Native-Land.ca as a starting point for learning about Indigenous territories, languages, treaties, and, most importantly, the relationships Indigenous peoples have with Land & Waters.
