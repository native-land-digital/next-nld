Native Land works from YOUR contributions — however you can offer them. We welcome feedback and contributions of all kinds. If your nation is missing or incorrectly represented, if we are wrong in any of our information, or you have any ideas, issues, or other thoughts you would like to share, you can contact us at any of the email addresses listed below.

**Please note** that, while we value and read all emails we receive and do our best to make site edits promptly, we are a small team of Indigenous peoples working to update, correct, and validate the information and resources visible on the map. It may take us longer than usual to respond to your inquiry. 

**Please take the time to send your correspondence to the correct email address.**

If you are an **Indigenous person, nation, tribe, or organization** wishing to speak to us about **updates, corrections, or to share information and resources**, please write to:

**nations@native-land.ca**

If you **have questions, comments, feedback, or other information** relating to **the main-page map** and our **research processes**, please write to:

**research@native-land.ca**

If you are reporting an issue related to **the** **technological function of the site** (bugs, broken website links, site errors), please write to:
