## Support Native Land

If you’re part of an organization, please check out our [**Supporter’s Circle**](https://native-land.ca/support/supporters-circle) for ways to get involved.

Native Land is proud to be celebrating **10 years** of sharing Indigenous territories, languages, and perspectives with the world. Since its creation in 2015 by founder Victor Temprano, Native Land has grown from a personal project into a global nonprofit organization. Over the years, we've been generously supported by funders such as the Kalliopeia Foundation, Nia Tero, Vancouver Foundation, Vancity Credit Union, and others. As we continue to grow, we’re working toward long-term sustainability — and we need your help to get there.

We now have a small but mighty team of dedicated individuals working regularly for Native Land, including:
- **Indigenous Executive Director** – Indigenous academic leadership
- **Indigenous Digital Communications Coordinator** – specializing in creative engagement from an Indigenous perspective
- **Indigenous Research Lead** – focused on management and community building
- **Indigenous Research Assistant** – specializing in Indigenous mapping and knowledge systems
- **New Tech Development is continued by our Founder Victor Temprano**
- **Grant Writer expert**

Our **Board of Directors** is also growing, and we have many exciting projects on the horizon.
Native Land is, and will continue to be, a fully **Indigenous-led and Indigenous-run** organization. It’s deeply important to us that this project remains grounded in Indigenous voices, values, and leadership — created by and for Indigenous Peoples.

If you decide to support us, here are just some of the things your contribution will help fund:
- Fair wages for our employees
- Establishment of Youth & Elder Advisory Councils
- Ongoing research and global expansion of the map
- Participation in conferences and gatherings on Indigenous mapping
- Community-based territory research and direct engagement
- Improved educational tools like teacher’s guides and outreach resources
- Documentaries made by Indigenous communities to help share their stories

And here are a few of our long-term dreams:
- A **podcast** about Indigenous territories, tech + Indigeneity, language revitalization, and more
- A **regular newsletter** and community updates
- Hosting and participating in **conferences** worldwide
- **On-the-ground research** into territories and languages
- Working directly with educators to **enhance the teaching** of Indigenous history
- Supporting **connections between Indigenous communities** across borders
- Offering **tech tools and resources** to communities to amplify their voices

We’ve got big dreams — and this is really just the beginning. We’d love for you to be part of the journey.
Thank you for reading, and thank you for your support — in whatever form it takes. We're grateful that this project continues to resonate with so many people around the world.
