## Reciprocity Map

A new way to move beyond land acknowledgements.

The Reciprocity Layer highlights global Indigenous-led projects, stories of reclamation, recovery, rematriation, and resistance. It brings visibility to the ongoing work happening on Indigenous lands: from cultural revitalisation and environmental restoration, to the challenges faced by nations today, such as extractive industries and governance struggles.

This layer is a living map of Indigenous excellence. It invites users not just to learn whose land they are on, but to understand what those nations are calling for—what support is needed, what is being protected, and how to stand in meaningful solidarity.

Whether you’re offering a land acknowledgement, developing partnerships, or simply wanting to do better, the Reciprocity Layer shows you how to act with intention and care.
